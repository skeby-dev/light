# LIGHT BOT

## This is the official repo of the covenant light bot

## Description
Hah, you've found me, the offical repo of covenant light bot. Just so you know covenant here stands for CU. If you know, you know, if you don't, forget bout it. Anyways i built this bot to make the life of a lot of cu students more easier. I felt telegram bot is the best way to go because at the time of writing this i don't know much about being a software developer, so bear with me.

Okay, so i used telegraf as the wrapper for the bot, it was the most popular for using node to interact with the bot and i felt it'd help me get more intimate with javascript. I know, weird right, i said it like that. Well i like javascript, its bascically my first programming language. Well, technically python was my first, but i had nothing to show for it.

I'm rambling, sorry about that, honestly you aren't suppose to see this, i set my repo to private. Nobody's suppose to see this but me. Except i messed up in settings.

Yh so here's the link to the [Telegraf]( https://telegrafjs.org/#/) site in case you need it. If you don't get chat gpt is your friend.
Also the link to the [Telegram bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)
