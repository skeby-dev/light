# 🌟 LIGHT BOT - Your Fun Companion at CU 🌟

## Description

Hey there, welcome to the super-duper official repository of **LIGHT BOT** - your new best friend at CU! 🎉

In the world of inside jokes, "Covenant" secretly means CU. But hey, no worries if you're not in on it; we'll still be best buds! 😉 

**LIGHT BOT** is here to make your life at CU a total breeze. We picked Telegram because it's like the coolest hangout spot for bots! 💬

You know, we might not be expert developers (yet), but we're learning and growing together! 💪 JavaScript is our go-to language, and it's been super fun to work with. Though Python once had a place in our hearts, JavaScript stole the spotlight! 🚀

Okay, okay, we weren't supposed to spill the beans, but you caught us! Our repository was set to private, but guess what? You're part of our exclusive crew now! 🙊
